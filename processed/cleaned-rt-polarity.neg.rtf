__label__negative the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
__label__negative it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .

__label__negative there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser .

__label__negative nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
__label__negative this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
__label__negative the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
__label__negative "a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . "
__label__negative a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

__label__negative "despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . "
__label__negative director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
__label__negative . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
__label__negative never comes together as a coherent whole . 
__label__negative an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .

__label__negative don't even bother to rent this on video . 
__label__negative "there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . "
__label__negative this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
__label__negative "not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . "
__label__negative "plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . "
__label__negative "the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . "
__label__negative a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
__label__negative an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
__label__negative "bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . "
__label__negative gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up .

__label__negative . . . stale and uninspired . 
__label__negative a dreary movie . 
__label__negative . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
__label__negative "instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? "
__label__negative it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
__label__negative this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
__label__negative mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens .

__label__negative "blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . "

__label__negative "starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . "
__label__negative the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
__label__negative "the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid . "

__label__negative "love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . "

__label__negative "as social expos\'e9 , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . "
__label__negative the whole film has this sneaky feel to it \'96 as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
__label__negative "there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . "

__label__negative a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
__label__negative a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
__label__negative it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
